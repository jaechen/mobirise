Weber defines the modern state as not merely a set of institutions but as a relationship of legitimate domination enabled by a monopoly of violence within a given territory. (78) Brown expands upon Weber’s definition of the state by illustrating it as a paradox of “at once an incoherent, multifaceted ensemble of power relations and vehicle of massive domination.” (174) It is a network comprising of a multitude of practices and institutions, of systems and structures, of relations and forces, therefore, it would be inaccurate to consider it a monolithic and unified entity. Brown further elaborates on the state as a “significantly unbounded terrain of powers and techniques, an ensemble of discourses, rules, and practices, cohabiting in limited, tension-ridden, often contradictory relation with one another.” (174) Though it is rife with tensions and contradictions, the state manages to achieve a “degree of power and control” that allows it to come to function as a “vehicle of massive domination.” (174) Despite its incoherence and abstraction, the state is still “capable of tremendous economic, political, and ecological effects.” (174) Under the framework of the state as a messy entanglement of historical, political, and economic relations, Brown then disaggregates its monopoly of violence into four modalities.&nbsp;</strong></p><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brown conceptualizes contemporary US state power as masculinist by which it is a historical product of male domination and is intrinsically gendered. (173) As a historical product of male domination, Brown clarifies how it is not the power of men or the state overtly serving the interests of men but that the modern state has taken over and transformed a power historically controlled by systems of patriarchy. (193) In other words, building upon Weber’s “process of political expropriation,” the state has appropriated a masculinist power from men. (193-194) In a subtle and diffused way, the state presents itself as the deliberator of women. How the state exercises its masculinist power is sketched out in four modalities: liberal, capitalist, prerogative, and bureaucratic.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first modality of masculinist power is the liberal dimension premised upon the structure of public and private spheres. Civil society constitutes the public sphere where the state guarantees rights, whereas the private sphere consists of the family, guaranteed of privacy and beyond the reach of state interference. (181) This historical division of public and private is the central and unspoken ethos of liberal doctrine and theory in imagining the emergence of the state. Liberalism’s construction of the private sphere depoliticizing the family, particularly women, their labor and situations within it. As Brown explains, “historically, the ‘private sphere’ is not actually a realm of privacy for women to the extent that it is a place of unfettered access to a woman by her husband and children.” (181) The law does not apply to the private patriarchal household thereby granting men autonomous access to women and children without ramifications. The private sphere is a realm of resituated violence and vulnerability for women, whose access to the public sphere is limited by unrecognized and unpaid household responsibilities. Therefore, public rights and freedoms in civil society are more and more disconnected from women. (184)&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The capitalist dimension of the masculinist state also operates under the public/private division where almost all men perform “paid ‘productive’ labor,” almost all women perform “unpaid reproductive labor,” and “the majority of women do both.” (184) In carving out the sexual division of labor, Brown reveals that capitalism is intrinsically gendered. (185) It has historically ensured a “reserve army of low-wage labor” consisting primarily of women, therefore making women more and more economically dependent on men and the welfare state for survival. (185) In addition to devaluing reproductive work, capitalism finds new markets in the commodification of women’s work in the private sphere.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third modality is the bureaucratic dimension which Brown argues to be a powerful instrument of domination in masking gendered operations. Women’s terms of economic survival, reproductive rights, and sexual and political actions are swallowed up by the state’s bureaucracy of processes, legislations, and regulations. The state holds authority over every aspect women’s lives and “does not simply address private needs or issues but configures, administers, and produces them.” (195) Thus, Brown demonstrates the state as “the new man,” a historical product of male domination. It emerges to manage the monopoly of violence and inevitably generates gendered effects. (194)</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last most fundamental modality to Brown’s concept of a masculinist state is prerogative power— the legitimate monopoly of the arbitrary power of policy making and violence. The state holds the power to simultaneously violate and protect to the “extent to which politics between men are always already the politics of exchanging, violating, protecting, and regulating women; the one constituted the imperatives of the other.” (188) The imperative to protect necessitates the imperative to violate. This power is at the root of every state and as society moves into modernity, prerogative power does not diminish but is instead resituated into and contained in both the private sphere and state protected institutions. Prerogative power, “rationalized and legitimized in most international state activity,” therefore explains the War on Terror and its means of intelligence gathering. (187)</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The War on Terror is a war on intelligence. Applying the particular modality of prerogative power, Brown contends that pre-emption necessitated the imperative to simultaneously violate and protect— to protect the US from another attack required penetrating into other countries for intelligence and doing so with the violent means of torture and interrogation. (187) This prerogative power is carried out by a bundle of messy relations resembled by state. The spine of the government, the chain of command, included the ensemble of military personnels, officials, military psychologist teams, and more. The pressure to increase intelligence allowed for the expansion of prerogative power in the executive branch and policies that ended up exacerbating and ensuring both terrorism and continuance of the war. Its arbitrary violence is more explained in that since there was no clear guidance for interrogation, unauthorized techniques in contravention to the Geneva Convention were able to take on a global migration from its development in Bagram to its implementation in Guantanamo Bay.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The means of interrogation and torture, the spread and mutation of the US’ arbitrary policy making and violence, reveal how prerogative power has not declined in the liberal state but exists as the fundamental basis. Brown explains, “Violence of the state of nature is not overcome but reorganized and restated in… the state itself as the politics and the military.” (187) There exists a hierarchy of violence in which those higher up enact and enforce its prerogative power, or monopoly of legitimate violence, upon those lower on the hierarchy. Therefore, the term “terrorism” is a fabrication orchestrated by the state in order to embed violence and justify its receiving end.</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><p></p></div>
