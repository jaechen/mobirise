With this historical framework, Wolff emphasizes two aspects he sees to be significant about the crisis: how its origin and life transcend the financial realm and the disastrous relationship between the business community and the working class. When he makes these distinctions, he is revealing the myriad of factors, be it social or political, that keep this pattern of crisis in American history persistent.</strong><br></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Wolff emphasizes that the issue at root is the whole economic system in the United States. These crisis are not limited to finances, to banking or credit markets, rather crisis emerge from the very workings and structures the economic system is built on. It is built on the colonization of Indigenous lands and the annihilation of its population, and from this act of greed and superiority, “limitless” lands were opened up for an unprecedented 150 years of American prosperity, all of which spurred the notion of “American exceptionalism.” The GEC was rooted in a history of American exceptionalism. Wolff would say that the behaviors of lenders, investment banks, CEOs, and the other prominent players in the GEC embody the characteristics of “American exceptionalism.” The psychological inclination of those players to accumulate at all costs and to engage in corrupt competition is remarkably embedded in, what Wolff may even say defines, the nature of the market and overall American culture. As revealed in his timeline, the bubbles are built up by speculation. The investment banks, labeled “Too Big to Fail” banks, operated with excessive confidence to collect investments but it ultimately resulted in capitalists destroying their own markets and generating these long histories of economic fluctuations.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wolff applies the Marxist concept of class, as explained by Engels, to the relationship between the capitalists and working class. Wolff emphasizes that the “coping response to trauma” of the businesses and working class are “ingredients for crisis” as one seeks short-term profits through exploitation of the other. Beginning in the 1970s, the working class needed to find a way to survive with incoming additional sets of costs and flat wages. In the working class’ struggle, capitalists found a way to increase capital accumulation through “hundreds of billions of dollars in unsecured credit” that they loaned with the knowledge that it will inevitably default. Wolff calls this “a society out of control… It’s so profitable to push debt on the American people that everybody does it,” and what it results in is a situation of an “exploding profitable” on one side and a “desperate, exhausted population” dictated by a culture of rising consumption on the other. In an economy of promises of high returns and false claims that turn out to be catastrophic, Wolff argues the only way for society to rebound from the crisis is to find or invent new markets and forms of debt as history has shown to do but at this current stage where society is still suffering from the lingering consequences of the GEC, Wolff is uncertain of the next new market. Essentially, Wolff asserts that crisis are inevitable in capitalism and that “capitalism sows the seed of its own destruction.”</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through a Neo-Marxist lens, Fred Block emphasizes economic rebounds with a structuralist explanation, particularly how “capitalist rationality emerges out of the three-sided relationship among capitalists, workers, and state managers.” (67) Block begins with debunking the idea of a ruling class consciousness, rejecting the agency of each set of actors. Rather than the capitalists orchestrating the outcomes, each group is pursuing its own structural interest and the outcome “occurs ‘behind the backs’... so that rationality cannot be seen as a function of the consciousness of one particular group.” (52) With these structural boundaries, interests of the state and capitalists overlap because “state managers are so dependent upon the workings of the investment accumulation process, it is natural that they will use whatever resources are available to aid that process.” (62) It is only the state’s concern for the reproduction of political and social order in order to maintain their regime. Leading up to the crisis, banks and the rest of the financial market were highly deregulated as it was the state’s only job to establish the institutional frameworks and rely on the inner workings of the market to maintain “some reasonable level of economic activity.” (58) The state requires a strong economy bolstered by capital investment, or “business confidence,” which was shown in the “Too Big to Fail” banks. (59) In the GEC, the SCC and Federal Reserve played a central role in serving the capitalists and fueling the crisis. (54) These structural dynamics change when the economy begins to decline and fall into crisis.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Block, the GEC is the culmination of class conflict. As the capitalists further pursue short-term profit at the expense of the working class’ living standards and economic stability, class struggle heightens, shaking the state’s public support. (61) This is depicted in Block’s exceptional times explanation wherein public support shifts to become the state’s top priority. The state achieves its momentary “relative autonomy” and financial reforms were implemented by the Bush and Obama administrations to relieve the economic chaos. However, as we revert back to normal times, the state resumes its role as a tool of the state. Reforms for the working class weaken as capitalists find ways to dismantle the programs and allocate the wealth back to them. In addition, the government bailed out the investment banks not in the interest of the capitalist class but to revive a strong economy and public support.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What Block lastly emphasizes is that as we go back and forth between the structural dynamics in crisis, the state gains more power. As the GEC began to recede and the state began to contract its hand of relative autonomy, top economic advisors involved in the GEC were appointed to the Obama administration. The US also resisted strict regulations imposed by European nations. The capitalist system is then rationalized and reproduced.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To explain the GEC, David Harvey foregrounds class struggle and neoliberalism as a project of the ruling class. Neoliberalism emerged in the 1970s as the economic elite’s response to the crisis of capital accumulation. (14) Harvey shows that neoliberalization has very much diverged from neoliberal theory and is conflicted with internal contradictions. (67) One of its contradictions being the neoliberal state’s increasing presence in maintaining corporate power.</strong></div><div><strong>Unlike Block, Harvey explains the causes of the GEC as a result of the “revolving door” meaning the “boundary between the state and corporate power has become more and more porous.” (77-78) Corporate lobbyists were working in tandem with the state to not subvert but to serve the capitalists’ interests. The ruling class orchestrated the crisis with the help of the state. The global economic elite saw itself as a class with agency collectively acting in its interest by neoliberalism. The investment banks knew their subprime loans were going to default, however, more and more risky CDOs were invested in and betted on. Through predatory lending and leveraging on massive amounts of money, it was a class assault by the 1%. Even when the bank failed, its industry was exempt from all liability and able to recuperate with the help of the government that bailed them out. Therefore, what reproduces neoliberalism and its intrinsic crisis is the state that is forced to deal with the disorder and aftermath of the boom.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, Harvey emphasizes the fundamental concept of accumulation of dispossession as a way to manage and manipulate crisis. When the managers of the firms pursue short-term profits only to dump stocks and allow their firm to fall apart, the consequences are felt by the working class and investors. If capitalists find their markets exhausted, than wealth can just be redistributed. This has resulted in the elite regaining huge portions of wealth and the exacerbation of inequality.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wolff, Block, and Harvey as Marxists believe that capitalism generates crisis of overproduction and holds irreconcilable class conflict. They would also agree that the state is not the solution in times of crisis. Wolff’s historical examination showed how the state’s policies and regulations failed as they were dismantled by corporate members who had every incentive and resource to do so. The nature of the capitalist system is to undo whatever regulation obstructs their pursuit of profit, meaning any monetary or fiscal policies will continue to fail. Block asserts that the state operates accordingly with its two hands, one for working class demands and the other for the ruling class. Both classes are irreconcilable. The state is only bringing temporary order to capitalism and continues to fix a system that is broken. Like Wolff, Block agrees that when times go back to normal, the state reverts to serving the interests of the bosses and issues disputed are swallowed in state bureaucracy. Harvey sees the state as working alongside the ruling class to continue a free market.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All authors would agree that there is an intrinsic logic to capitalism that produces increasing inequality as time goes on. All agree and warn that each successive crisis will intensify and become more extreme. Wolff and Harvey reveal how state intervention will exacerbate future crisis as booms and busts are closely correlated with growing inequality after the 1980s. With each crisis, the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. Poverty charges interest— it is expensive to be poor. The effects of the Global Economic Crisis of 2008 can be seen in today’s rampant situation of homelessness and housing crisis.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, how they approach and view the relationship between state and capital as the nature of the problem is where they diverge and emphasize different contradictions. First, Harvey does not find the lack of new market an issue like Wolff brings up. Through accumulation by dispossession, the state “becomes a prime agent of redistributive politics, reversing the flow from upper to lower classes… through pursuit of privatization schemes and cutbacks in those state expenditures that support the social wage.” (165) In other words, wealth and power are redistributed back to the top executives and banks who can find another material aspect to commodify. Wolff contends that it is not about finances rather the system in its entirety and the American cultural values around consumption. Block emphasizes the role of financialization in generating global economic crisis and views the state and ruling class as two distinct groups distinguished by their structural boundaries. Harvey views that relationship as “porous” and a “revolving door” persisting in creating unstable economies and downturns. Rife with contradictions, capitalism is prone to instability and extreme inequality.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></div>
