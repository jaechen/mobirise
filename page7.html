However, the state has always been driven to “tag, monitor, and criminalize” its civilians, and it is only with the “galvanizing and palpable” experience of 9/11 “for a previously impervious population” that occasioned “the aggressive proliferation of commercially based identification, registration, and tracking.” (3) Parenti premises his conceptualization of privacy and state surveillance power upon this important note— that the expanding capacity for surveillance is not a contemporary problem but a historical one developed as an effort to manage race and class domination. As a Foucauldian, Parenti traces the historical development of state surveillance power in the US beginning with slavery to modern surveillance techniques which he calls “dataveillance.”&nbsp;</strong></p><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parenti emphasizes the development of state surveillance power in the framework of the dialectic tension between regulation and resistance. (21) Systems of identification and surveillance during slavery were developed through the need to regulate and repress the mobility of slaves and subsequently any threats to subvert the power of the master class. (15) The plantation surveillance system was created with three key “information technologies”: slave pass, slave patrols, and wanted posters, which respectively developed into the first forms of state mandated ID, US police force, and biometric ID. (15) Forms of resistance to these inchoate identification systems included stealing and gaining literacy skills to forge slave passes. Slavery, in many ways, is characterized by resistance. As time went on, surveillance technologies grew to be photography, biometrics, dactyloscopy, and to mass registration, particularly of the Chinese population that like the “Antebellum hackers” in slavery forged identification papers. Foucault writes, “Where there is power, there is resistance.” (65) The pluralities of resistance are born within and exist among the network of power. Parenti’s historical account illustrates Foucault’s concept on how regulation and resistance evolve alongside each other.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parenti emphasizes the emergence of dataveillance, the new surveillance that “often ignores the physical body and instead tracks one’s informational doppelganger.” (4) These include universal individual identifiers, databases, and telecommunications networks that now play an increasingly prevalent and pervasive role in the criminal justice system. The proliferation of surveillance technologies include random drug tests, ankle bracelets with GPS tracking, “gang” databases, and state DNA databases that act as pre-emptive surveillance strategies. (173, 175) These technologies arbitrarily define criminality, demarcate suspect populations, and are wielded by the state’s disposal against “society’s weakest, most marginalized groups, and then through function creep spreads in toward the mainstream.” (179) In other words, those lower in the hierarchy, namely poor black and brown communities, simultaneously are faced with state-created conditions (such as poverty and the War on Drugs) and state surveillance systems aimed at protecting its citizens from the very conditions it has created. Parenti contends that the ramification arising from the state’s increasing capacity for surveillance is a “panoptic effect” in which unannounced visits from probation officers, drug tests, and more discipline the individual to internalize the police gaze and begin to self-regulate. Moreso, “transparency plus strict rules guarantee parole failure” and high recidivism rates so that it is not only privacy that is denied to them but also a whole range of civil liberties including freedom of mobility. (174-175) In the management of race and class power relations, privacy for those communities of color are diminished.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With dataveillance and biometrics, Parenti draws on Foucault by explaining how the data produced from DNA is collected, studied, and used to generate “politically useful forms of knowledge and behavior” so that “moral and cultural categories like ‘madness’ and ‘criminality’ are… accurately named by science so much as they are built by the political and scientific practice and discourses.” (9) Foucault warns of science to be a “new regime of truth” with omniscient efficacy in instilling obedience and correction into bodies. As Parenti states, “Whatever biology madness involves, it is also always bound up with, and never appears outside of… historically specific forms of knowledge.” (9) Power is knowledge and knowledge is power.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Foucault’s theory of disciplinary power is central to Parenti’s approach on “privacy.” Parenti critiques the common understanding of privacy to be limited because like Foucault, he sees the state’s surveillance power as a disciplinary power that has gradually transformed into a horrible, repulsive, and unspectacular way to subjugate without corporeal violence. Therefore, with this extent to which state surveillance has exceeded its power, the definition of privacy must be taken beyond the innocent and law-abiding individual’s right to be left alone. Taking from the very text of the Declaration of Independence, Parenti defines privacy as the constitutional right to a space for illegalities— one beyond the government’s reach where people can collectively organize and mobilize against governmental power. (210) Privacy, then defined by Parenti, guarantees a resource to the people to organize, mobilize, and resist so to not descend into an obedient society of docile subjects.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><div><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Foucault’s theory of disciplinary power is central to Parenti’s approach on “privacy.” Parenti critiques the common understanding of privacy to be limited because like Foucault, he sees the state’s surveillance power as a disciplinary power that has gradually transformed into a horrible, repulsive, and unspectacular way to subjugate without corporeal violence.
